# php_polar_graphics_svg
This class can render a math formula as a SVG vectorial chart.  It takes a string with a math 
formula and creates a chart on which it draws a set of lines between consecutive points for the axes. 
It may use cartesian or polar coordinates.  The class returns the chart data in SVG format.
It can also render a chart in SVG format from an array of coordinates passed to the class. 
The size of the chart and the size of the steps between each point in the chart are configurable parameters.
